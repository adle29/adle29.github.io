title: After the Test
---

Summary: This post is about the test, the team project, and using Slack. 

**What did you do this past week?**

We had the test this past week. The test was not hard but it was a bit tricky. One really needs to know every single trickery in the world of Python. I think the best study technique I could have done was type down every single example the professor showed in class as well make my own challenges in creating functions included in Python's modules, such as zip, filter, reduce, etc.. 
**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I have the Computer Security final for this Friday and tons of homework. Moreover, we need to finish with the new project. Half of my classes are finished for the summer. Again I need to brush up with the new readings and examples from the class.

**What will I do next week?**

This next week I will continue working with my team on the project. It has been great. We have integrated slack and we have set up a good organization. Each member must have their own branch to work on, we have a development branch, and also a production branch. Slack has been very useful to keep the team connected. 

**Tip-of-the-week**

For the tip of the week, I recommend students to start project in a field they find fun and productive. You should familiarize with using github and perhaps even work with a friend. Integrating slack with github has proved to be a very useful tool to keep all the commits organized and publicly known to a team's members.
