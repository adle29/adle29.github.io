Summary: Talked about the third project, classes, and setting up infrastructure. 

**What did you do this past week?**

These past weeks I worked with my team on the IDB project. We setup up a github repository, added issues, made an account on digital ocean, and started rolling the production of our site. We had to find an API which provided the data for our web-app. It was really interesting building the infrastructure for the unit tests, routes, the database schemas, and the whole front-end. We divided the work by assigning members to work on the models, the wiki, the unit tests, and server/website. 

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I am taking the Compilers class which I heard is the third hardest class at UT. Hopefully, the load of work from both classes don't consume all my time. I will do my best to learn the most of both classes. I also have a Government class which I hope is not too heavy. 

**What will I do next week?**

Next week, we will populate the website, make the unit tests run directly from the website, and make the website prettier. I am working on connecting the database to the server and making the basic skeleton of a script that populates the database.  

**Tip-of-the-week**

For the tip of the week, I recommend checking all requirements for you project. We worked really hard on this project but since we didn't verified some steps before that put some pressure on us. Start with the requirements first!!
