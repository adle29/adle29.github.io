Summary: Last day of class. 

The class has finished! It was a hell of a ride. It was amazing working with my team and creating a functional web application. The class was intense, meaning that it required good organization and discipline. Quizzes were definitely the hardest thing to work on. Start early, read the assignments, practice what you learn daily and you will achieve sucess in the class. Type down by youself every program the professor shows in class. Reading/reviewing material is sometimes not enough, but actually making those programs will teach you the concepts deeply. 

It was definitely a challenging class; however, it is one of the most applicable classes you can take. When one gets to work on companies, being able to learn new technologies by yourself, depend on your team, and being able to come up with a plan are vital steps for any job in the industry. The best way to improve is to start self projects as well as start learning to some extent every rising technology. If you are able to have some knowledge from databases to server to web design, you will not only work as member of a team but perhaps even become the leader of the team. Good luck!
