**What did you do this past week?**

This is the first entry of the blog! This past week I worked on setting a git repository for the class assignment and linking it with Travis CI, a continuous integration tool. With Travis CI, a virtual machine will be spawned an will run the tests for your repository.  I also learned more about algorithm optimization and unit testing with python. We are supposed to work on a simple program, which at first glance seems easy, but after have it graded by [sphere](http://www.spoj.com/) the challenge is trying to maximize the speed of the computations. After I kept improving the program, I saw more and more ways on how to refractor/optimize the code. I created failure and corner cases to test every function of my program. I have learned tremendously on the development of applications. 

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

Preparing for this week is on my way, I read all the material before hand, I began working early on the assignment, and payed high attention on the lectures. Quizzes are challenging, requiring concentration as well as continuous preparation. 

**What will I do next week?**

Next week, I will finish my project and tomorrow begin the new one, which is supposed to be a team assignment. It will be interesting to see how others collaborate with github. I am looking forward to work with my team. Moreover, I will make sure to finish all the new readings for this week. 

**Tip-of-the-week**

Lastly, for the tip of the week, I learned about several competitive programming websites such as [code force](http://codeforces.com) and sphere. I will take on a coding challenge per day at least, to polish my coding skills. I highly recommend any computer science students to practice coding problems.
